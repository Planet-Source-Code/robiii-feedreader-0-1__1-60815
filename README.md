## FeedReader 0\.1


</div>

### Description

Use this object (which can be compiled into an ActiveX DLL) to read ATOM, RSS and RDF feeds. It exposes a simple object model with which you can retrieve a feed in 1 line of code and enumerate all items in the feed with just a few other lines of code. Documentation is provided in the code itself and in a PDF file that is included in the zipfile.
 
### More Info
 
Check the documentation and source code for assumptions of components that need to be installed (don't worry, only MS components and 99% chance they're allready on your system).
