Open Main.vbg (located in the "Source" folder) to open the main
project containing a demo application. The object itself can be
compiled into an ActiveX DLL by opening the project in the
"Source\Component" folder. The demo application is a simple
demonstration of how to open and read a feed (the code contains
demo feeds for ATOM, RSS and RDF). You can also open any feed
you like by entering it's url in the demo application.

I have also included documentation in a PDF file which explains
all properties and methods which the objects expose. The
documentation is straightforward and by far not intended to be
complete. Should you encounter any problems, then check the
sourcecode for any remarks or notes. It may point you in the
right direction.

I do not, will not and cannot support this code. If you
encounter any problems you'll have to figure it out yourself by
debugging the code. If you do not like the way I have set up
this project you can use it as a guideline for creating yor own
project or alter the code to make it work as you want it to. In
other words: It's all yours!

Enjoy!
